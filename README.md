Description
===========

This is a template to deploy an [Elasticsearch](http://www.elasticsearch.org/)
cluster with [OpenStackHeat](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Heat) on the [Rackspace
Cloud](http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/). This template uses
[chef-solo](http://docs.opscode.com/chef_solo.html) to configure the servers.

Requirements
============
* A Heat provider that supports the Rackspace `OS::Heat::ChefSolo` plugin.
* An OpenStack username, password, and tenant id.
* [python-heatclient](https://github.com/openstack/python-heatclient) `>= v0.2.8`:

```bash
pip install python-heatclient
```

We recommend installing the client within a [Python virtual
environment](http://www.virtualenv.org/).

Example Usage
=============
Here is an example of how to deploy this template using the
[python-heatclient](https://github.com/openstack/python-heatclient):

```
heat --os-username <OS-USERNAME> --os-password <OS-PASSWORD> --os-tenant-id \
  <TENANT-ID> --os-auth-url https://identity.api.rackspacecloud.com/v2.0/ \
  stack-create elasticsearch-stack -f elasticsearch.yaml \
  -P es_node_count=4
```

* For UK customers, use `https://lon.identity.api.rackspacecloud.com/v2.0/` as
the `--os-auth-url`.

Optionally, set environmental variables to avoid needing to provide these
values every time a call is made:

```
export OS_USERNAME=<USERNAME>
export OS_PASSWORD=<PASSWORD>
export OS_TENANT_ID=<TENANT-ID>
export OS_AUTH_URL=<AUTH-URL>
```

Parameters
==========
Parameters can be replaced with your own values when standing up a stack. Use
the `-P` flag to specify a custom parameter.

* `load_balancer_hostname`: Sets the name of the load balancer. (Default: es-lb)
* `server_hostname`: Configures the hostname for the Elasticsearch nodes (Default: es)
* `flavor`: Cloud server flavor to use. (Default: 2 GB Performance)
* `ssh_keypair_name`: Name of the SSH key pair to register with nova (Default:
  elasticsearch)
* `es_auth_user`: userid for HTTP basic authentication when connecting to the
  Elasticsearch service. This will also apply to connections made via the
  load balancer. (Default: es_user)

Outputs
=======
Once a stack comes online, use `heat output-list` to see all available outputs.
Use `heat output-show <OUTPUT NAME>` to get the value fo a specific output.

* `es_server_ips`: Public IP addresses for the Elasticsearch nodes created.
* `private_key`: SSH private key that can be used to login as root to the servers.
* `es_auth_user`: userid for HTTP basic auth
* `es_password`: generated password for HTTP basic auth
* `load_balancer_ip`: Public IP address of the cloud load balancer

For multi-line values, the response will come in an escaped form. To get rid of
the escapes, use `echo -e '<STRING>' > file.txt`. For vim users, a substitution
can be done within a file using `%s/\\n/\r/g`.

Stack Details
=============
Each elasticsearch instance is proxied via nginx on port 8080, with HTTP basic
authentication, a userid as configured by the parameter `es_auth_user`, and
a random password generated by the Heat engine.

The load balancer is configured to accept connections on port 8080 and
distribute connections round-robin to the Elasticsearch nodes.

Contributing
============
There are substantial changes still happening within the [OpenStack
Heat](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Heat) project. Template contribution
guidelines will be drafted in the near future.
